Welcome to the Accenture Playlist repository! This project is dedicated to compiling a collection of coding questions specifically tailored for preparing for Accenture's technical assessments and interviews. Here, you'll find a variety of problems that cover key topics and concepts commonly encountered in Accenture's recruitment process. Each question is designed to help you sharpen your problem-solving skills and improve your coding proficiency. Whether you're gearing up for an interview or just looking to practice, this playlist is a valuable resource to aid your preparation. Feel free to explore, practice, and contribute!
